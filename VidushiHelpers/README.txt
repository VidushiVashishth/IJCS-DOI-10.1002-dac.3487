Information about this folder
=============================

This folder contains python scripts utilised to run the simulation repeatedly and collect the results in csv format. 
Modifications need to be done to the vidushi_script.py to print the required results of the simulation. The current code 
prints the values of delivery probability to data.csv file after every run of the simulation.
